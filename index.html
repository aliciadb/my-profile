				<h2>Travel</h2>
				<p>I have traveled a lot (USA, Asia, Africa, Europe, ...) and I have proved I can quickly and easily adapt myself to new environments. I am convinced that living abroad (1 year in Berlin and 5 years in Barcelona), as well as interacting with different cultures, are key components to  get an open mind and a better understanding of the world and the business.</p>

				<p>Besides my travels, my other personal interests are community services and musicals; I'm quite liable in some important skills such as coordination and communication within a  group, organization, rigor, commitment and giving the best under (time) pressure. I am a motivated and multitasking person willing to take on challenging responsibilities while learning new aspects of the job.</p>
